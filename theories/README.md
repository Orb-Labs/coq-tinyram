# `TinyRAM` emulator in Coq

- Approach of copying Morgan's [haskell tinyram](https://github.com/Orbis-Tertius/tinyram) is in `CopyingMorgan/`. This approach is basically not being pursued. 
- Everything else is with `itrees` (see `../papers/itrees.pdf`), including `Types.v` and `VN/*.v`. `Utils/*.v` are plagiarized from the `itrees` tutorial repo.
